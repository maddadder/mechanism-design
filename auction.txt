A dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) auction

Management R provides a pair (or more) of compatible buyers B
 - compatible meaning two independent buyers desire the same type of %product%

We are going to do a 2nd price auction using Myerson's Lemma

let t be a member of B
let u be a member of B

let the sales department provide products P and begin interacting with B

let p be a member of P

t is paired with p
u is paired with p

For simplicity, let's say t and u are bidding for the same p, although not required

Rules:
1. Prices must increase by a factor of $10.00
2. You must auction off p
3. In order for a bid to be valid it must be ever increasing (monotone)
4. Winner takes all

Questions:
Why would we turn down business from the losing bidder?
 - The buyer's intrinsic value was lower for that product

Relaxations:
1. Managment may turn down low bidders if too busy
2. For high value buyers, don't bother using an auction
3. If you trust their bid there is no need to auction

Statement:
Some bidders will just go with the flow because we are trusted and given our setup there is no resistance. In other words, when we play faily, others will too.
